        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br>
         It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.<br>
         Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,<br>
         consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,<br>
         discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"<br>
         (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,<br>
          very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",</p>
